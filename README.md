# Overview

This is a repo containing all of my Python labwork from ECE310.

# Usage

Simply install the necessary libraries (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, jupyter, ipykernel) and run the Jupyter notebooks in VSCode. I recommend using the `uv` package manager and setting up a virtual environment for this repo.
